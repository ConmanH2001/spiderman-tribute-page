            <p>Peter Parker was an average nerdy teenager who one day got bitten by a spider. That spider was radioactive and he gained the abilits of a spider which he used for street fighting for money. One day when he was walking he witnessed a robbery, the man ran past him and Peter let him run on by, thats when the robber shot his uncle and stole his car. Peter held his Uncle ben in his arms as he whispered his final words: "with great power comes great responsibility." This became a drivng force for peter in becoming spiderman and never turning away from helping someone else again.</p>
